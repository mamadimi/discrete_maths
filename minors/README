Find if a graph A is minor of a graph B.
In graph theory, an undirected graph H is called a minor of the graph G if H 
can be formed from G by deleting edges and vertices and by contracting edges.

According to Wagner's theorem, a graph is planar if and only if the complete graph K5 or the complete bipartite graph K3,3 are minors of it.
